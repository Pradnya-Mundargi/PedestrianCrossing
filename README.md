# Pedestrian Crossing
In this problem the opensource JAAD dataset is used, which you can read more about here: http://data.nvision2.eecs.yorku.ca/JAAD_dataset/ 

The dataset consists of tracked people in some videos from a car's dashcam.  Each of these people have been carefully annotated with a bunch of different attributes, such as whether or not they are stopped or moving fast or moving slow.  For this problem we will try to predict whether or not the pedestrian will cross the street in the next frame based on all previous data we have about the pedestrian.
